This is the official Material Comic Viewer repository.

The app was released some time ago, but because of school I didn't have that much time to work on the app anymore. Because of this I decided to make the app open source. I hope fans of the app want to contribute into adding new features and just plain optimizing the app some more. I will also continue working on the app, but only when I find the time to do this.
