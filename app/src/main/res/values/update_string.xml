        Hi! My name is Cédric Vandelaer and first of all thanks for checking out my app! I\'m a master student computer
        science at the university of Hasselt (Belgium) and I enjoy reading comics in my free time. I\'m also a big fan
        of android so I decided to make a comic viewer app in my free time. I wasn\'t really happy with existing apps because of
        their poor performance, overly complex interfaces or just because I didn\'t like how they looked. Well anyway, have fun reading
        comics with Comic Viewer!
